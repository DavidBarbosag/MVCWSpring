# Serving Web Content with Spring MVC

## What You Will Build

You will build an application that has a static home page and that will also accept HTTP GET requests at: http://localhost:8080/greeting.

It will respond with a web page that displays HTML. The body of the HTML will contain a greeting: “Hello, World!”

You can customize the greeting with an optional name parameter in the query string. The URL might then be http://localhost:8080/greeting?name=User.

The name parameter value overrides the default value of World and is reflected in the response by the content changing to “Hello, User!”

## What You Need

* About 15 minutes

* A favorite text editor or IDE
